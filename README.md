# ParserYM
ParserYM - a program that receives all tracks and their authors from the music page of the streamer [bratishkinoff](https://www.twitch.tv/bratishkinoff).
# How to use
All you need is to install Python (written in version 3.13), and then run the .bat file
# Compatible
Windows only support
# How it works
The program opens the browser, waits 30 seconds to solve the captcha (yes, I was too lazy to do this), after scrolling the page to get all the data, it closes and after a while writes everything into a .txt file and opens it
